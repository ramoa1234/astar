# astar

need to correct the implementation and way that the nodes and there squares are drawn

and implement the a star 
setting curr to prev
than setting curr to next node
recursive calling
condition

bugfix
need to correct infinite loop
  need to double check that loop end conditions are correct
  and that openset is properly having the values removed from
    could be that the variables from between openSet and checkNeighbours is not correct
    probably has to do with the way that openSet is returned in checkNeighbours



PRIORITY QUEUE
make it so that nodes 


var h = Math.sqrt((x - (columns - 1)) * (x - (columns - 1)) + (y - (rows - 1)) * (y - (rows - 1)));
